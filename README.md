# Face expression detection

This is a project for detecting/classifying human facial expressions. The larger
context is towards the abilities for AI agents (or robots more specifically) to 
interact with human agents. Human agents communicate in varying levels, from verbal to
non-verbal forms. Facial expressions are a non-verbal form.

Ultimately, it is about the possibility of an AI to attain something akin to theory
of mind: the ability to recognize an other as a conscious agent with intentions and
feelings as well as external behaviors, which motivate those behaviors.

## Files

**LiveDetect.py** -- Python script to demonstrate the use of a predictive model in
real-time inference.

**Notebooks** -- contains Jupyter notebooks exploring a variety of machine learning
approaches, including face landmark detection for expression embedding, random forest and
SVM classifiers, as well as convolutional neural networks. Run predominantly in
Google Colab.

**Models** -- Trained convolutional models

**Data** -- the original FER2013 dataset, as downloaded from Kaggle, in ZIP form. 

**Images** -- imgaes to be used in publications
